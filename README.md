evolution simulation without neural networks  
code *wip*. im using this projec to learn a new programming language, so it may be syntactically ugly or inefficient.<br><br>
i had a dream where i was able to create a virtual superhuman organism which developed a brain more intelligent than any artifical intelligence or human currently active. i dont think this is possible, but it would be cool to see an organism evolve *notably* without waiting for millions of years.<br>
i've heard darwin's theory of evolution (who hasn't?) but i want to see if i can replicate this behaviour in **very** basic virtual organisms by introducing some random development in chosen traits alongside controlled changes in the environment.
